Difference between UINT8 and DOUBLE images during PSNR
There are some differences during calculating the psnr of an images. The UINT8 format will give you a higher percentage of psnr in correlation with double format.
In these code, we prepare you with both of the codes wich related to calculate psnr:

# Results
In picture below, we can see the psnr and ssim of an uint8 image (which are our output images of GANDI architecture of denoising)
